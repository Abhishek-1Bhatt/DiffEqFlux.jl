There are three main ways to partition our data when using a training algorithm like gradient descent: stochastic, batching and mini-batching. Stochastic gradient descent trains on a single random data point each epoch. This allows for the neural network to better converge to the global minimum even on noisy data but is computationally inefficient. Batch gradient descent trains on the whole data set each epoch and while computationally effiecient is prone to converging to local minima. Mini-batching combines both of these advantages and by training on a small random \"mini-batch\" of the data each epoch can converge to the global minimum while remaining more computationally effiecient than stochastic descent. Typically we do this by randomly selecting subsets of the data each epoch and use this subset to train on. We can also pre-batch the data by creating an iterator holding these randomly selected batches before beginning to train. The proper size for the batch can be determined expirementally.

When memory is not an issue, we find that the QuadratureAdjoint approach tends to be the most efficient as it has a significantly smaller adjoint differential equation and the quadrature converges very fast, but this form requires holding the full continuous solution of the adjoint which can be a significant burden for large parameter problems.

Then in the adjoint, intervals of sol.t[i-1] to sol.t[i] are re-solved in order to obtain a short interpolation which can be utilized in the adjoints.
